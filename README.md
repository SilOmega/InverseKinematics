# InverseKinematics

The classes listed in this repository describe the Unity's implementation for a basic unconstrained inverse kinematics for an arm using the palm of the had as end effector and the cylinder as a target. Different ways of tracking have been implemented as the Pseudo Inverse Method usiing the Jacobian matrix and Cyclic-Coordinate Descent.
